ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Shresth Shukla this side.

ðŸ‘€ It's been a year exploring different career options, and data analytics come out as the perfect kickstart to it. Currently looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects as an analyst.
  
My skill sets include - Data cleaning, data pre-processing, and data mining using tools and technologies like MSSQL, MYSQL, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn, and more as required.

Reporting tools: Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, and open to learning any as required.

One thing that I'm sure about is, there is no limitation to the number of tools to work with data. I might not know all of them but if required, give me 20 hours and I'll be decent enough in any skill you may ask.
